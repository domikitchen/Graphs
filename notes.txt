Graphs
------

Nodes are connected by edges

Edgets *may* have numeric weights associated with them
- If not shown, assume all weights are 1

Edges can be directed (one way) of undirected (two way)
- If there are *only* undirected edges, we call it an "undirected graph"
- Else we call it a "directed graph"


Representation of Graphs
------------------------

Which nodes are adjacent ("directly connected") to a particular node.

Adjacent matrix
- Big grid that has true/false values showing which nodes are adjacent
    - Or edge weights


Adjacent list (what we'll use)

A -> B <-> C
\   |
\/  \/
    D

A: {B, D}
B: {D, C}
C: {C, B}
D: {}


BFT
---
Init:
    Add the starting vert to the queue
While the queue is not empty:
    Pop current vert off queue
    If not visited:
        "Visit" the node
        Track it as visited
        Add all its neighbors (adjacent nodes) to the queue
